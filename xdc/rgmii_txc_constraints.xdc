# The RGMII module is responsible for forwarding teh txc clock that is
# used for data recovery by the PHY. This clock is output using an ODDR which
# is fed by 2 registers (txc_1 and txc_2). These launching registers are driven
# by the 125MHz clock. However, the RGMII standard specifies that the tx data and
# tx clock should not be aligned (introduce a 90 degree phase shift). Therefore, the
# ODDR (only for the txc) is driven by a 125MHz clock with a 90 degree phase shift.
# To avoid timing violations a multicycle path must be specified to ensure that
# the latching clock edge occurs 2 clock cycles after the launch edge or else
# the setup time will be violated.
